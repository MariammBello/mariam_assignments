                    <h4>This is an About me page for Altschool Assignment1</h4>
                    <p>My name is Mariam Bello, an Actuary by profession, Financial Investment consultant, and aspiring DevOps Engineer. I am currently working as an actuary at an Insurance company in Lisbon. I'm passionate about change and knowledge acquisition, so I have opted for this school program to explore cloud engineering. I love to document and write about my journey, so in my free time, I create study and learning content on my Blog, Finance Conversation, and YouTube.</p>

                    <h3>Doing my first assignment</h3>
                    <p>After my first HTML class with AltSchool, I was initially confused by the skeletal results. I was curious about creating more visually appealing web pages and began experimenting with HTML elements.</p>
                    <p>Although I was excited to learn about CSS, the assignment required creating pages strictly without CSS, which presented a unique challenge. I wrote about it in my learning medium notes (add external links).</p>
                    <p>Anyway, I started working on my assignment and decided to use tables and pictures to build this webpage. Even though it is just an about us, I'm making a mini documentation of how I did it. Like my GitHub README.</p>
