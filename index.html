                    <h4>This is an About me page for Altschool Assignment1</h4>
                    <p>My name is Mariam Bello, an Actuary by profession, Financial Investment consultant, and aspiring DevOps Engineer. I am currently working as an actuary at an Insurance company in Lisbon. I'm passionate about change and knowledge acquisition, so I have opted for this school program to explore cloud engineering. I love to document and write about my journey, so in my free time, I create study and learning content on my Blog, Finance Conversation, and YouTube.</p>

                    <h3>Doing my first assignment</h3>
                    <p>After my first HTML class with AltSchool, I was initially confused by the skeletal results. I was curious about creating more visually appealing web pages and began experimenting with HTML elements.</p>
                    <p>Although I was excited to learn about CSS, the assignment required creating pages strictly without CSS, which presented a unique challenge. I wrote about it in my learning medium notes (add external links).</p>
                    <p>Anyway, I started working on my assignment and decided to use tables and pictures to build this webpage. Even though it is just an about us, I'm making a mini documentation of how I did it. Like my GitHub README.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <a href="https://karatu.oluwasetemi.dev/114"><h3>Assignment1 question</h3></a>
                    <h4>Build two web pages</h4>
                    <p>The first is going to be about you, including your ALT SCHOOL ID, biography, and any relevant information with reasons why you joined Alt School, your goals for the School of Engineering program. Use fragment identifiers and build a feature to scroll to the top with a fragment identifier.</p>
                    <p>The second page is a form that is a replica of the ALT SCHOOL application form, linking both pages together using global navigation, and the page must be accessible with proper relevant semantic HTML tags.</p>
                    <pre><code>index.html<br>form.html</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>NB:</strong> Strictly without CSS. Submission details will be sent to you in due time.</p>
